# 🏏 Cricket Management System

## Overview

The Cricket Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify the management of cricket club operations.  
The system provides a centralized interface to maintain player records, track attendance, manage fees, and handle tour-related information.

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor’s final year project and focuses mainly on frontend development, user interaction, and form-based workflows, while using PHP and MySQL for backend support.

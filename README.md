# Cricket-Management-system
 I created a project called Cricket Management System for the final year of my Bachelor of Technology. • In this project, We maintain the records and entries of particular players like players, Fees, Attendance, and Tours. • Mainly designed for cricket clubs or institutes to organize their student details efficiently.

#--------------------------------ABSTRACT----------------------------------------------------
Cricket Management Software is a software application that maintains the records related to cricket sports players. It also takes care of money transactions at the organization. It includes money collection from the organization by different sources. This application can be used by the organization to manage cricket sport data effectively. This system will reduce manual work and avoid redundant data. By maintaining the player attendance fees and tour manually, then efficient reports cannot be generated. The system can generate efficient weekly, consolidated reports based on attendance. As the fees, attendance, tour, and player details are maintained in registers it has been a tough task for admin and staff to maintain for a long time. Instead, the software can keep long and retrieve the information when needed.

 
#--------------------------------PREFACE----------------------------------------------------
The development of this application is highly economically feasible. The only thing to be done is to create an environment with effective supervision.
It is cost-effective in the sense that has eliminates the paperwork. The system is also time effective because the calculations are automated which are made at the end of the month or as per the user's requirement.

#-----------------------CONCLUSION:-----------------------------------------
The system has been tested under all criteria. All phases of development were conceived using methodologies. The application executes successfully by fulfilling the objectives of the project. Further extensions to this system can be made required with minor modifications.
SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Security implementation is very important in almost every software project.
In this project, user authentication is placed, when the application runs, a login screen will be displayed where the user needs to enter his credentials to gain access to the system.
In this system, there is login access for authenticated persons only, like admin. This user has complete access to the system.
FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

The Current System can include many more enhancements. These are as follows:
Buy from the card is optional in this project.
There is no verification while buying from the card.
The Payment Gateway is not added to this project.
As mentioned earlier, the project is a web-based application. This will convert into
Android application which will enhance the project.
Hence, the current software will be updated soon to overcome the limitations specified above.
